   * @brief This is the base class to describe states in a NucleicAlphabet.
   *
   * This class store a binary code for each state.
   * This binary code is of length 4, one bit per nucleotid.
   * For DNA alphabet, this code looks like this:
   * <table>
   * <tr><th>Letter</th><th>Binary code</th><th>int value</th></tr>
   * <tr><td>-</td><td>0000</td><td>0</td></tr>
   * <tr><td>A</td><td>0001</td><td>1</td></tr>
   * <tr><td>C</td><td>0010</td><td>2</td></tr>
   * <tr><td>G</td><td>0100</td><td>4</td></tr>
   * <tr><td>T</td><td>1000</td><td>8</td></tr>
   * <tr><td>N</td><td>1111</td><td>15</td></tr>
   * <tr><td>...</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
   * <tr><td>M</td><td>0011</td><td>3</td></tr>
   * <tr><td>W</td><td>1001</td><td>9</td></tr>
   * <tr><td>...</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
   * <tr><td>V</td><td>0111</td><td>7</td></tr>
   * </table>
   * This notation allows the use of bitwize operations like:
   *   - build a generic state from to states
   * @code
   * A | G = R  <=>  0001 | 0100 = 0101
   * @endcode
   *   - extract a state from an unresolved one by subtraction of an other state
   * @code
   * S & ~ C = G  <=>  0110 & ~ 0010 = 0100
   * @endcode
   *
   * The binary code is stored as a char because it's the smallest memory word
   * that can be allocated. A char is 8 bits long allowing the use of this
   * class with Alphabet of at least 8 resolved states (enough for known
   * nucleic alphabets!).
