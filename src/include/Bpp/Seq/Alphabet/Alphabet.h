/**
 * @mainpage
 *
 * @par
 * This library provides classes to store and analyse biological sequences.
 * Each position in a sequences is coded by a int. An object implementing the bpp::Alphabet
 * interface is used to make the relation between the int code and its more common character
 * representation. Support for DNA, RNA, protein and codon sequences is provided. The
 * bpp::AlphabetTools provides tools to deal with Alphabet objects.
 * The basic bpp::Sequence class contains the code sequence, a name for the sequence
 * and optionally comments. More elaborated classes can be built by inheriting this class.
 * The bpp::SequenceTools static class provides simple analysis tools, like base frequencies measures,
 * concatenation, etc. 
 * 
 * @par
 * SeqLib also provides tools to perform <i>in silico</i> molecular biology, like complementation,
 * transcription, translation, etc. All these methods are particular cases of alphabet translation, and are implemented
 * via the interface bpp::Translator. Of particular interest are the classes bpp::NucleicAcidsReplication,
 * bpp::DNAToRNA and bpp::GeneticCode + derivatives.
 *
 * @par
 * Sequence collections are stored as <em>containers</em>. The simplest container implements the
 * bpp::SequenceContainer interface, providing access to sequences by their name.
 * The bpp::OrderedSequenceContainer adds access by position in the container.
 * The simplest implementation of this interface is the bpp::VectorSequenceContainer, which stores the sequences
 * as a vector of bpp::Sequence objects (or instances inheriting from this class).
 * Input/output from various file formats is provided, including fasta (bpp::Fasta), GenBank (bpp::GenBank) and Mase (bpp::Mase).
 * Tools dealing with containers can be found in the bpp::SequenceContainerTools static class.
 *
 * @par
 * Support for alignments is provided via the bpp::SiteContainer interface, which enables site access.
 * Sites are stored as a distinct class, similar to a "vertical" sequence, called bpp::Site.
 * It shares several methods with the bpp::Sequence object, although it does not contain a name but
 * a position attribute. This attribute can be used to track the position of sites when handling
 * alignments (for instance after removing all gap-containing sites).
 * There are currently two implementations of the bpp::SiteContainer interface:
 * - bpp::AlignedSequenceContainer, inheriting from bpp::VectorSequenceContainer and adding the site access.
 *   Sequence access is hence in @f$o(1)@f$ and site access in @f$o(n)@f$, n being the total number of sites.
 * - bpp::VectorSiteContainer is a symmetric implementation, storing the data as a vector of bpp::Site objects,
 *   providing site access in @f$o(1)@f$ but sequence access in @f$o(m)@f$, m being the total number of sequences.
 * The static classes bpp::SiteTools and bpp::SiteContainerTools provide some tools (for instance: pairwise alignment) to deal respectively with
 * bpp::Site and bpp::SiteContainer objects. I/O is provided for several formats, including Clustal (bpp::Clustal) and Phylip (bpp::Phylip).
 *
 * @par
 * Bio++ SeqLib also contains support for sequence properties, like amino-acids biochemical properties.
 * The interfaces bpp::AlphabetIndex1 and bpp::AlphabetIndex2 provides methods to deal with indices in 1 and 2 dimensions
 * respectively. Several basic properties are provided, together with input from the AAIndex databases.

/**
 * @brief The Alphabet interface.
 * 
 * An alphabet object defines all the states allowed for a particular type of
 * sequence. These states are coded as a string and an integer.
 * The string description is the one found in the text (human comprehensive)
 * description of sequences, typically in sequence files.
 * However, for computionnal needs, this is often more efficient to store the sequences as
 * a vector of integers.
 * The link between the two descriptions is made <i>via</i>
 * the Alphabet classes, and the two methods intToChar() and charToInt().
 * The Alphabet interface also provides other methods, like getting the full name
 * of the states and so on.
 *
 * An Alphabet object in itself stores the states as AlphabetStates object, in a
 * potentially arbitrary but consistent series. All states are then indexed from
 * 0 to 'numbersOfChars'. The number of states is equal to the number of string
 * representations, but is usually higher than the number of int representation,
 * as several characters can correspond to the same state (for instance X, N and ?
 * in nucleotide alphabets).
 * 
 * The alphabet objects may throw several exceptions derived of the AlphabetException
 * class.
 *
 * @see AlphabetException, BadCharException, BadIntException
