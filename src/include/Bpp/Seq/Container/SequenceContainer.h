/**
 * @brief The SequenceContainer interface.
 *
 * This interface is the most general one in the container hierarchy.
 * No assumption is made on the sequences in the container (no ordering, no alignment).
 * Sequences may be retrieved using their names, which must be unique.
 *
 * The container is the only one responsible for the allocation/destruction of sequences it
 * contains. This means that any sequence passed to it will be <strong>copied</strong> into the container.
 * The container also provides methods that send const pointers towards these sequences
 * (without performing any copy of the underlying objects).
 *
 * Notes :
 * 1. methods for adding sequences to the container are not declared here
 * (so they can't be used throught this interface),
 * because these methods take sequence container's type specific parameters
 * (i.e. a key for map sequence containers);
 * 2. to delete a sequence from a container, one must use the appropriate method
 * (removeSequence() and deleteSequence()).
 * These methods performs a few check, and properly update pointers.
 * You should never delete a sequence from a container by yourself.
 *
