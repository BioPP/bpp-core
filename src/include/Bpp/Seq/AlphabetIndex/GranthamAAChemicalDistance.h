/**
 * @brief Grantham (1974) Amino-Acid chemical distance.
 *
 * Two kinds of matrix can be built:
 * - a symmetric one, with \f$I_{i,j} = I_{i,j}\f$,
 * - or a non-symmetric one, with \f$I_{i,j} = -I_{i,j}\f$.
 * In the second case, which one of the two entries between \f$I_{i,j}\f$ and \f$I_{i,j}\f$ is positive is arbitrary by default.
 * It is also possible to use the coordinate on a principal component analysis between the elementary propoerties of the distance instead (setPC1Sign(true)).
 * The following R code was use in order to get those signs:
 * @code
 * library(seqinr)
 * data(aaindex)
 * data<-data.frame(composition=aaindex[["GRAR740101"]]$I,
 *                     polarity=aaindex[["GRAR740102"]]$I,
 *                       volume=aaindex[["GRAR740103"]]$I)
 * library(ade4)
 * pca<-dudi.pca(data)
 *
 * plot(pca$li[, 1:2], type="n")
 * text(pca$li[, 1:2], rownames(data))
 *
 * s.corcircle(pca$co)
 * layout(matrix(1:3,nrow=1))
 * a1<-pca$li[,1]; names(a1)<-rownames(data); dotchart(sort(a1))
 * a2<-pca$li[,2]; names(a2)<-rownames(data); dotchart(sort(a2))
 * a3<-pca$li[,3]; names(a3)<-rownames(data); dotchart(sort(a3))
 *
 * x<-pca$li[,1] #Contains the coordinates on the first axis.
 * m<-matrix(nrow=20, ncol=20)
 * for(i in 1:length(x))
 *   for(j in 1:length(x))
 *     m[i,j]<-sign(x[j] - x[i])
 *
 * @endcode
