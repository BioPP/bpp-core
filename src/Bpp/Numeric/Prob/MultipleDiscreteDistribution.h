 * @brief Interface for multiple discrete distribution objects.
 *
 * A multiple discrete distribution usually contains a vector of
 * finite set of categories and a probability associated to each.
 * The size of the vector is the dimension of the distribution.
 *
 * Each category (or class) is defined by two bounds, and sometimes
 * by a mean or a median value.
 *
 * A multiple discrete distribution may contain one or several
 * parameters. The probabilities associated to each class usually
 * depends on the parameter values. In some cases, the number and/or
 * bounds of the classes may also depend on the parameters values,
 * depending on the kind of discretization used.
