/**
 * @brief Discretized Dirichlet distribution. If the distribution is
 * in n dimensions, the domain is the n-1 simplex.
 *
 * The discretization is made in the order of these dimensions. Then
 * the order of the dimensions is not neutral on the resulting
 * categories.
 *
 * Here is an example of the discretization process: if the
 * distribution is in 3 dimensions, and the number of categories is
 * 4 in the first dimension, 3 in the second and 5 in the third, the
 * first interval is split in 4 equi-probable intervals, and each
 * interval is split on the second dimension in 3 equi-probable
 * intervals, and each of the 12 resulting 2D intervals is split in
 * 5 equi-probable 3D-intervals. Eventually, there are 60
 * equi-probable categories.
 *
 * In the same example, if the distribution is followed by the
 * random vector @f$ (X_1,X_2,X_3) @f$, the 1D distribution used for
 * @f$ X_1 @f$ is the marginal distribution, which discretized
 * values are say, @f$ v_1^1, v_1^2, v_1^3, v_1^4 @f$, then the four
 * 1D distributions used for @f$ X_2 @f$ are the conditional
 * marginal distributions @f$ (X_2|X_1=v_1^1), (X_2|X_1=v_1^2),
 * (X_2|X_1=v_1^3), (X_2|X_1=v_1^4) @f$. And in a similar way for
 * @f$ X_3 @f$, with the 12 resulting conditions on @f$ X_1 @f$ and
 * @f$ X_2 @f$.
 *
 *
 * It uses the AbstractDiscreteDistribution comparator class to deal
 * with double precision. By default, category values that differ
 * less than 10E-9 will be considered identical.
 *
 *
 * The successive discretization process is done using the
 * distributions, if the parameters are @f$ (\alpha_1, ...,
 * \alpha_n)@f$:
 *
 * @f$ X_1 @f$ follows Beta(@f$ \alpha_1, \sum_{i=2}^n \alpha_i @f$).
 *
 * @f$ X_j @f$ follows @f$ (1-\sum_{i=1}^{j-1} X_i) @f$ *
 * Beta(@f$ \alpha_j, \sum_{i=j+1}^n \alpha_i @f$).
 *
 * @f$ X_n = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} X_i @f$.
 *
 *
 * The parameters are: alpha_1, ... alpha_n @f$ \in [0.0001;\infty[
 * @f$.
