   * @brief Interface for discrete distribution objects.
   *
   * A discrete distribution usually contains a finite set of
   * categories and a probability associated to each.
   * 
   * Each category (or class) is defined by two bounds, and sometimes by
   * a mean or a median value.
   *
   * A discrete distribution may contain one or several parameters.
   * The probabilities associated to each class usually depends on
   * the parameter values.
   * In some cases, the number and/or bounds of the classes may also 
   * depend on the parameters values, depending on the kind of
   * discretization used.
