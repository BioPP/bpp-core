   *
   * The false discovery rate is computed by sorting all pvalues.
   * The FDR r is calculated with the formula
   * @f$ r = p * n / i@f$
   * where p is the p-value, n is the number of tests (the size of the input vector) and i is the rank of the p-value, that is the index in the sorted array.
