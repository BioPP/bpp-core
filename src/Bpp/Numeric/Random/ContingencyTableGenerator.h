 * @brief Generate a random contingency matrix with given marginal counts.
 *
 * This procedure was adapted from the original fortran code described in:
 * Patefield, W. M. (1981) Algorithm AS159.  An efficient method of
 * generating r x c tables with given row and column totals.
 * _Applied Statistics_ *30*, 91-97.
 * This algorithm is the one also used in R function chisq.test for instance.
 *
 * The code was adpated from file rcont.c, edited by Martin Maechler, Dec 2003,
 * available in the R software source distribution.
 *
 * @param nrowt Marginal counts.
 * @param ncolt Marginal counts.
 * @return A random matrix of counts with the same marginals as specified.
