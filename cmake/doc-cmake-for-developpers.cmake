cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.8.11)
# 2.8.11 is required for:
# - clean target properties (link, include dir)

project (bpp-something CXX)
# Defines a lot of stuff including PROJECT_NAME which will contain "bpp-something"
# PROJECT_NAME is used to name:
# - the library
# - the CMake targets (${PROJECT_NAME}-static or ${PROJECT_NAME}-shared)
# - the CMake package
# Do not change it unless there is a good reason...

set (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "std=c++11 -Wall -Weffc++ -Wshadow -Wconversion")
# Define compile options to be used for all C++ targets.
# NOTES for the future:
# -> CMake >= 2.8.12 adds per target COMPILE_OPTIONS by using target_compile_options (<target> [PRIVATE|PUBLIC] <opt1> ... <optN>)
# -> CMake >= 3.1.x provides a CXX_STANDARD variable to set -std=...
# -> It also provides a "feature" property on targets which annotates, and auto selects the right -std=...

# In other words, the library implements all the interface numbers in the
# range from number current - age to current.
# NOTE: unchanged from old cmake.

set (PROJECT_VERSION ${${PROJECT_NAME}_VERSION})

# They must be installed to standard paths, or to the target install path (hence the search path addition).
# If a version is provided, it will check that the found component is version-compatible with what we requested.
# -> Detects when we link to an old bpp version.
# Internally, this executes the package files of the needed components if they are found.
#
# Package files will include their targets file that define "imported targets".
# using target_link_libraries (current_target bpp-neededcomponent-static) will add link, include, and compile option flags to the whole compilation.
# For convenience package files also define the BPP_LIBS_SHARED and BPP_LIBS_STATIC variables.
# These variables hold a list of all imported shared or static library targets of bpp.
# 
# GNUInstallDirs is a standard CMake module that defines distribution-specific install paths.
# We use:
# - CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR : system specific <prefix>/lib.
#   It automatically adds a '64' suffix if 64 bits, and an arch subdir on debian.
# - CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR : for homogeneity, in practice it is always <prefix>/include.
